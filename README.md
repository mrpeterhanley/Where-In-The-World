# 🗺️ Where-In-The-World 🗺️

I built this project for the Frontend Mentor Challenge <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca">"REST Countries API with color theme switcher"</a><br>
<br>
This application was built with React, and uses the It is based on the <a href="https://restcountries.eu/">REST Countries API</a> to retrieve and display data countries worldwide. Search for a specific country based on a name search string, and / or filter results by region. Click on a country card to display more detailed information about that country, including bordering countries (which you may also click to display detailed information about that country)<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy using it!
