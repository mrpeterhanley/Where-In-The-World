# üó∫Ô∏è Where-In-The-World

I built this project for the Frontend Mentor Challenge <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca">REST Countries API with color theme switcher</a><br>
<br>
This application was built with React, and uses the <a href="https://restcountries.eu/">REST Countries API</a> to retrieve and display data from countries worldwide. Search for a specific country based on a name string, and / or filter results by region. Click on a country card to display more detailed information about that country, including bordering countries (which you may also click to display detailed information about that country)<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy using it!<br>
